xcellent choice. Using Render's built-in monitoring for infrastructure
  health and Sentry for application-level error and performance tracking is a
  very common and powerful combination. They complement each other perfectly.

  Here's a breakdown of how they work together and the steps to implement this:

  How Render and Sentry Work Together

   * They are separate but complementary. They don't directly integrate in the
     sense that one controls the other. Instead, they monitor different layers
     of your application stack.
   * Render's Role (Infrastructure-level):
       * Monitors the "health" of your service's container: Is it running? Is
         it restarting?
       * Tracks resource utilization: CPU usage, memory consumption.
       * Collects and displays raw logs (stdout/stderr) from your application.
         This is useful for basic debugging but can be noisy and hard to
         search.
   * Sentry's Role (Application-level):
       * Error Tracking: Automatically captures unhandled exceptions in your
         Node.js code (like TypeError: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined).
         It groups identical errors, shows you the exact line of code, the
         request details, and user context.
       * Performance Monitoring: Traces how long different parts of your code
         take to execute, helping you identify performance bottlenecks (e.g.,
         slow database queries, inefficient functions).
       * Alerting: Provides much more intelligent and configurable alerting
         than simple log-based alerts. You can get notified in Slack, email,
         etc., when a new type of error appears or when an old one spikes.

  In short, Render tells you if your application is running. Sentry tells you
  how well it's running and notifies you immediately when something breaks.

  Implementation Plan

  Here is the step-by-step plan to integrate Sentry into your application:

   1. Create a Sentry Project:
       * Go to sentry.io (https://sentry.io) and create a free account if you
         don't have one.
       * Create a new project, selecting "Node.js" as the platform.
       * Sentry will provide you with a DSN (Data Source Name). This is a
         unique key for your project. We will need this.

   2. Install Sentry SDKs:
       * I will add the necessary Sentry packages to your package.json and
         install them. The core packages are @sentry/node and
         @sentry/profiling-node.

   3. Initialize Sentry in Your Application:
       * The Sentry SDK needs to be initialized as early as possible in your
         application's startup process. The best place for this is at the very
         top of your main entry file, which appears to be src/server.ts.
       * I will add the initialization code, which will read the DSN from an
         environment variable (SENTRY_DSN) for security.

   4. Add Express.js Middleware:
       * Sentry provides Express middleware to automatically capture request
         data and handle errors.
       * I will add Sentry.Handlers.requestHandler() and
         Sentry.Handlers.tracingHandler() at the beginning of your middleware
         chain in src/app.ts.
       * I will add Sentry.Handlers.errorHandler() before your existing error
         handling middleware in src/app.ts. This ensures that any errors caught
         by your routes are sent to Sentry.

   5. Configure Environment Variables in Render:
       * You will need to add the SENTRY_DSN you got from your Sentry project as
          an environment variable in your Render service settings. This keeps
         your secret key out of the source code.

   6. Create a Test Route (Optional but Recommended):
       * I can add a temporary route (e.g., /debug-sentry) that intentionally
         throws an error. This will allow you to immediately test that the
         Sentry integration is working correctly after deployment.

  This process is straightforward and will give you powerful error and
  performance monitoring capabilities with minimal overhead.

  Shall I proceed with step 2 and start by installing the necessary
  dependencies and adding the configuration files?
